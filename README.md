## Overview

Essh is an extended `ssh` command. If you use `essh` command instead of `ssh`, Your SSH operation becomes more efficient and convenient. Essh is a single binary CLI tool and simply wraps ssh command. You can use it in the same way as ssh. And it has useful features over ssh.

## Features

* **Configuration As Code**: You can write SSH client configuration (aka:`~/.ssh/config`) in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) code. So your ssh_config can become more dynamic.

* **Hooks**: Essh supports hooks that execute commands when it connects a remote server.

* **Servers List Management**: Essh provides utilities for managing hosts, that list and classify servers by using tags.

* **Per-Project Configuration**: Essh supports per-project configuration. This allows you to change SSH hosts config by changing current working directory.

* **Task Runner**: Task is a script that runs on remote and local servers. You can use it to automate your system administration tasks.
